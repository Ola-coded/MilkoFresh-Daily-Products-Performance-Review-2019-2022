Strategic Recommendation
1.	Prioritize High-Demand Products
o	Focus marketing and distribution efforts on Curd, Butter, and Lassi, given their high revenue and reorder rates.

3.	Leverage Leading Brands
o	Strengthen partnerships with Amul and Mother Dairy to maintain a stronghold in brand-driven consumer trust and volume.

4.	Optimize Underperforming Months
o	Run promotions and campaigns in March and October to boost demand and stabilize monthly revenue trends.

5.	Maximize Retail Channel Strength
o	Continue expanding retail footprints in high-performing regions, especially Chandigarh and Delhi, while also exploring hybrid models (retail + online) for growth.

6.	Revisit Storage for Low-Performing Products
o	Products in Ambient and Tetra Pack categories should be evaluated for pricing, placement, or reformulation to increase demand or reduce waste.
